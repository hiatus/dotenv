======
Bash functions to help in common workflows. All functions are prefixed with `.` such as `.dump.hex`,
a function that dumps input to the standard output as a hexadecimal string. To display all available
functions, just type `.<Tab><Tab>` after sourcing `load.bash` and shell completion should do the
job.


Installation
------------
Simply source `load.bash` from within a bash session.
```
user@host:~$ . load.bash
```
